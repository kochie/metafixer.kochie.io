      <p>
        The app operates locally on your device and does not transmit any data

      <h2>Your Consent</h2>
      <p>
        By using MetaFixer, you consent to this privacy policy. As we do not
        collect any data, there is no need for opt-in or opt-out mechanisms.

        privacy policy will change. However, we may update this policy to
